# ⚡ URGENT: HARD REFRESH REQUIRED!

## 🔥 YOU MUST DO THIS NOW:

### **Press: `Ctrl + Shift + R`** (Windows/Linux)
### **Press: `Cmd + Shift + R`** (Mac)

---

## Why?

The errors you're seeing are from **browser cache** showing old validation code!

Your errors:
- ❌ "Operation is required"  
- ❌ "Standard MH/UOM is required"

These are coming from your **IF-ELSE children** (TRUE/FALSE branches), not the LOOKUP!

---

## What I Fixed:

### Problem:
```
IF-ELSE Row
├─ TRUE child → Has operation/standardMh fields DISABLED
│              → But validation still checks them! ❌
└─ FALSE child → Has operation/standardMh fields DISABLED
               → But validation still checks them! ❌

LOOKUP Row → Also had validation issues
```

### Solution:
```javascript
// Now validation checks if row is a child of IF/IF-ELSE
const isIfElseChild = parentCondition === 'IF' || parentCondition === 'IF-ELSE';

// Skip operation/standardMh validation for IF/IF-ELSE children
if (row.conditionType === 'None' && !isIfElseChild) {
    // Only validate for root rows
}
```

---

## After Hard Refresh:

### ✅ What Will Work:
1. IF-ELSE children won't require operation/standardMh (they're disabled!)
2. LOOKUP won't require operation/standardMh (not needed!)
3. LOOKUP children will only validate type/value/comment
4. Save button will work! ✅

---

## Testing Steps:

1. **HARD REFRESH** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Look at your IF-ELSE children** - operation/standardMh are grayed out
3. **Click "Save Data"**
4. **Should save successfully!** ✅
5. **No more false errors!** 🎉

---

## If Still Not Working:

Try these in order:

### 1. Clear All Browser Cache
```
Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
```

### 2. Close All Tabs
```
Close ALL tabs of localhost:3000
Then reopen
```

### 3. Try Incognito/Private Mode
```
Open new incognito window
Go to localhost:3000/featuresv3
Test there
```

### 4. Check Console for Errors
```
Press F12 → Console tab
Look for red errors
Share them with me if you see any
```
